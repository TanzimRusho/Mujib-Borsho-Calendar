# Mujib-Borsho-Calendar
A simple program to convert a Gregorian calendar date to Mujib Borsho date.

I saw this program code in C++ from one of Friend of Friend's open source sharing. Then converted the program in Python.

Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is the Father of Nation of Bangladesh. A Bangla calendar named after him was proposed by Bangladesh Government.
